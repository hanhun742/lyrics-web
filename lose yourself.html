<strong>[Intro]</strong>
<p>
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo</p>
<p>Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
